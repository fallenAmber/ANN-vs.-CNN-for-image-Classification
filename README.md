# ANN-vs.-CNN-for-image-Classification


There are some problems of using traditional Artificial Neural Network for Image Classification such as Too much Computation, treating local and far pixels
as the same, sensative to a location or an object of an image, etc.

We can overcome such issues by adopting Convolution Neural Network (CNN). Convolution Neural Netowrk deals with the most distinctive features of an image.
CNN works much faster and proved way more efficient in tasks namely searching for objects on photos and in videos, face recognition, style transfer,
creating effects like slow-mo, improving image qualiuty and so on.

In this work, we are going to apply both ANN and CNN on CIFAR-10 dataset.
